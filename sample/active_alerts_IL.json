Local areas may receive\nrainfall amounts high enough to cause river rises, widespread\nponding of water, and localized flooding.\n\nAfter a recent soaking rainfall and freezing temperatures, soil\nmoisture is nearly ubiquitously above average in northern Illinois\nand northwestern Indiana. The current forecast of three quarters to\none inch of rainfall  may cause river stages to rise to near or\nabove bankfull, particularly along the Fox, Des Plaines, Rock, and\nKankakee River Basins. With already-elevated river stages along the\nIroquois and Illinois river basins, even limited rainfall amounts\nmay cause stages to rise near bankfull. The exact river basins that\nwill see near flood stage conditions is heavily dependent on the\nlocation of heavy rainfall.\n\nThis outlook means that elevated water levels and flooding impacts\nare possible, but not yet certain. Persons should closely monitor\nforecasts including the possibility of flood watches, warnings, and\nadvisories.",
